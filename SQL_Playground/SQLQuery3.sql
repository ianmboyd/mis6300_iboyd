/*
Find the product model IDs that have no product associated with them.  
To do this, first do an outer join between the Production.Product table and the Production.ProductModel table in such a way that the ID from the ProductModel table always shows, even if there is no product associate with it.  
Then, add a WHERE clause to specify that the ProductID IS NULL


Use left join
